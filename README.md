Accompanying data and runfiles that relate to simulations and results presented in the manuscript (Shalom ES, Van Loo S, Khan A, and Sourbron SP. Submitted. "Identifiability of spatiotemporal tissue perfusion models".) which utilise the functions and modules from [tkspace](https://github.com/EShalom/tkspace/).

In both directories there are:
   - A directory of " Outputs"  from all simulation runs and the corresponding plotting scripts
   - A directory of "Runfiles" with batch file production (tested on mac/linux)

1d1c - One dimensional one-compartment systems

Runfile information:
- Run files are split into two with:
   - case 1 and 2 having all positive boundary flow guesses
   - case 3 has negative boundary flow guesses
-This match to system descriptions



1d2c - One dimensional two-compartment systems

- In the code Cases 1, 2, and 3 from the manuscript correspond to cases 6, 11, and 3 in the run files and code
- Updating of the case naming is in progress this README will be updated when this is implemented.
